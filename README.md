[![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-unreleased_changelog)

## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-unreleased_changelog`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin unreleased_changelog
```

## About unreleased_changelog
A fastlane plugin to manage unreleased changelog using a YAML file. üöÄ

This plugin is inspired by and based on [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) project. [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) proposes a standardised format for keeping change log of your project repository in `Changelog.yml` file. This file contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project in human readable format.

Since [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) project proposes a well-defined structure with _sections_ (e.g.: `[Unreleased]`, `[0.3.0]`) and _subsections_ (`Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`) it opens up an opportunity to automate reading from/writing to `Changelog.yml` with [`fastlane`](https://fastlane.tools). 

## Actions
`fastlane-plugin-changelog` consists of 5 actions enabling you to manipulate `Changelog.yml` from [`fastlane`](https://fastlane.tools).

### üïµüèª ensure_unreleased_changelog

Ensures the content of the `Unreleased` section from your project's `Changelog.yml` file. `Changelog.yml` must follow structure proposed by [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) project. 

``` ruby
ensure_unreleased_changelog	# Raises an exception if Unreleased section is empty
```

``` ruby
ensure_unreleased_changelog(
  file_name: 'custom_changelog_file_name',	# Specify the YML changelog file name
  show_diff: false	# Show the `Unreleased` section changelog, if found. (dafault true)
)
```

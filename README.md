[![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-unreleased_changelog)

## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-unreleased_changelog`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin unreleased_changelog
```

## About unreleased_changelog
A fastlane plugin to manage unreleased changelog using a YAML file. üöÄ

This plugin is inspired by and based on [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) project. [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) proposes a standardised format for keeping change log of your project repository in `Changelog.yml` file. This file contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project in human readable format.

Since [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) project proposes a well-defined structure with _sections_ (e.g.: `[Unreleased]`, `[0.3.0]`) and _subsections_ (`Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`) it opens up an opportunity to automate reading from/writing to `Changelog.yml` with [`fastlane`](https://fastlane.tools). 

## YML changlog file structure
`Changelog.yml` file must follow structure proposed by [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) project. 

```yml
Unreleased:
  Added:
  - added new feature 1.1
  - added new feature 2.1
  Removed:
  - removed deprecated feature XYZ
  Fixed:
  - bug-fix 3
[0.1.0-Release] - 2020-04-30:
  Added:
  - added new feature 1
  - added new feature 2
  Fixed:
  - bug-fix 1
  - bug-fix 2
```
